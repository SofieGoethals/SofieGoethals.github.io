Hi! My name is Sofie Goethals. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia Business School, supervised by Professor Sandra Matz. Prior to that, I obtained my PhD in the Applied Data Mining group (Department of Engineering Management, Faculty of Business & Economics) at the University of Antwerp. Supervised by Professor David Martens, I studied how we can make AI more aligned with our ethical objectives.

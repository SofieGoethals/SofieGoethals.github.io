Hi! My name is Sofie Goethals. I am currently a PhD Researcher in the Applied Data Mining group (Department of Engineering Management, Faculty of Business & Economics) at the University of Antwerp. Supervised by Professor David Martens, I study how we can make AI more aligned with our ethical objectives.
In 2019, I obtained a Master's degree in Business Engineering from the KULeuven, and in 2020, I obtained a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, also from KULeuven.

## Research Interests
Trustworthy Machine Learning (Transparency, Fairness, Privacy); Explainable AI; Computational Social Science
